My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. The company version of this idea is roughly "Blind." The school version of this idea is roughly "Fizz." The community version of this idea used to be "Yik Yak." Please read the attached file thoroughly. It contains the code for the app and the Firestore database rules.

Please read the attached file thoroughly.
- For any code that needs editing, give me the FULL method or class. Even the unchanged parts.
- Ensure that code changes don’t break any existing functionality. 
- Occam's razor. Simple code is preferred.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.

I cannot up/downvote posts where users have “deleted” their accounts. I also can't up/downvote for some random posts. Please fix this. Users should be able to up/downvote all posts (by one point - I think this logic is fine)
