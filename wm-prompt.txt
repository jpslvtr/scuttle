My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. 

Please read the attached files thoroughly.
- For any code that needs editing, give me the FULL method or class. Even the unchanged parts.
- Ensure that code changes don‚Äôt break any existing functionality. 
- Occam's razor. Simple code is preferred.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.

In the login screen, can you edit the "App Store Review Access" to enable reviewers to log in with just email/password? I enabled email/password login in firebase and added this as a user

Email: scouttestreview@gmail.com
Password: scout^^^test^^^review

Please ensure that a corresponding user document is made for them where their userName is @appstorereview and their emoji is üßë‚Äçüíª

Hello, I couldn't find the "Reply" button in my thread with App Review, so I've pasted my message below. It's in response to a few issues with my app submission. I've since resubmitted and am awaiting review. Thanks!

Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed
I've enabled email/password sign-in, so we no longer go through Google. The credentials below should work now:
Username: scouttestreview@gmail.com
Password: scout^^^test^^^review

And I apologize for the delay; I had drafted responses for 2.33 and 4.8 but hadn't submitted them. It seems like 2.33 is good, but I'll paste what I had typed for both.

Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata
I've added a few more screenshots to demonstrate the app's functionality. The app is relatively simple, as it is primarily an anonymous feed.

Guideline 4.8 - Design - Login Services
Since Scuttle is exclusively for service members, it uses ID.me for authentication. I believe this qualifies under Guideline 4.8 as a "government or industry-backed citizen identification system or electronic ID to authenticate users," which should exempt us from the requirement to provide Sign in with Apple. App Store reviewers have a temporary "App Store Review Access" button in build 1.0.2, using login credentials. This button will not be present in the production build (1.0.1), which will only offer ID.me login.
