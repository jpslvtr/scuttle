My app Scuttlebutt is going to be an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. The company version of this idea is roughly "Blind." The school version of this idea is roughly "Fizz." The community version of this idea used to be "Yik Yak." Please read the attached file thoroughly. It contains the code for Scuttlebutt and the Firestore database rules.

For each file that needs to be edited, please give me the full code. Not just the code that needs editing; even the unchanged code. If any code involves an API key, include the actual API key in your response. When giving me edits, ensure that existing functionality is maintained.

My ask:
- In the "Home" screen, instead of "Scuttlebutt", can you have listed the current feed that is selected?
- In "You", can you center the emoji + username + edit icon? And In Settings, can you center the word Settings?
- Can you add a star to the left of the points integer (0 for now) in the home feed?
