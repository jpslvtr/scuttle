My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. The company version of this idea is roughly "Blind." The school version of this idea is roughly "Fizz." The community version of this idea used to be "Yik Yak." Please read the attached file thoroughly. It contains the code for the app and the Firestore database rules.

Please read the attached file thoroughly.
- For any code that needs editing, give me the FULL method or class. Even the unchanged parts.
- If any code involves an API key, include the actual API key in your response. If rules need to be updated, give me the complete revised set of rules.
- Ensure that code changes donâ€™t break asny existing functionality. 
- Occam's razor. Simple code is preferred.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.

Right now, I get a reload in these cases
- In Home tab + You tab (My Posts and Saved), when upvoting or downvoting a post, the whole screen reloads
- In the post details page, when upvoting or downvoting a post, the point update is smooth and nothing in the post reloads (which is great), but the associated comments are reloaded
- In the post details page, when upvoting or downvoting a comment, the point update is smooth but the username of the comment refreshes

Can we reduce the reloads and have a more smooth UI/UX?



Can you edit the user onboarding experience? Once they sign up / sign in with google, I'd like to prompt them for location information. If they don't want to give it, then they can manually pick a zone. But if they do provide it, then their zone will be recommended to them. And they can confirm before their zone is set. Zone = Command. 

Switching Commands in settings should easy too.

I want to have these as my zones.
