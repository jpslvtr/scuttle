My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. 

Please read the attached files thoroughly.
- For any code that needs editing, give me the FULL method or class. Even the unchanged parts.
- Ensure that code changes donâ€™t break any existing functionality. 
- Occam's razor. Simple code is preferred.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.

I want to be able to test and see feeds from other zones once this app is on the app store. How do I fake my location in the iphone simulator?
