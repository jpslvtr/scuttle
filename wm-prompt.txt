My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. The company version of this idea is roughly "Blind." The school version of this idea is roughly "Fizz." The community version of this idea used to be "Yik Yak." Please read the attached file thoroughly. It contains the code for the app and the Firestore database rules.

Please read the attached file thoroughly.
- For any code that needs editing, give me the FULL method or class. Even the unchanged parts.
- If any code involves an API key, include the actual API key in your response. If rules need to be updated, give me the complete revised set of rules.
- Ensure that code changes donâ€™t break any existing functionality. 
- Occam's razor. Simple code is preferred.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.

Similar to how we have a privacy policy screen, can you have an about screen and a guidelines screen? For the settings page

Content for about:

Welcome to Scuttle, an anonymous feed-based social app for service members to engage with other service members near them. As a Navy veteran, I initially focused on the Navy for this version. There are eight "zones," each with a generous radius: Norfolk, San Diego, Jacksonville, Pensacola, PNW, Japan, Hawaii, and the DMV. I initially considered setting zones at the command level, but decided against it due to OPSEC. All users' military status is verified through ID.me.

Blind exists for companies, Fizz for colleges, and while Yik Yak is no longer as widely used, Scuttle aims to fill a similar niche for service members. Whether you're temporarily on TDY and don't know anyone, or you want to connect with service members near you, Scuttle is here to help. The main difference between our "All Navy" feed and the Navy subreddit is that everyone on Scuttle is a verified military member.

The app is still in development and may have some bugs. Feedback and comments are welcome. Please feel free to contact jpslvtr@gmail.com.
