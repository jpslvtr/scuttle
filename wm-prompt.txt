My app Scuttle is an anonymous feed-based platform for service members to engage with other members of their command, branch of service, and the entire military. 

==================

Ask:

I use cloud firebase functions for authentication with id.me. But can you look for other places in my code that I could use cloud firebase functions that would improve the ux? Most actions in the app trigger a refresh and it would be nice if there was no refresh. Some examples:
- upvoting/downvoting a comment, deleting a comment you left in a post's post details page
- saving a post in the feed
- deleting a comment you left from your profile
For some reason upvoting/downvoting posts in the feed don't trigger a refresh. Upvoting/downvoting your own post in your profile also don't trigger a refresh. That's interesting.

==================

Guidance: 
- Whenever you provide code, ensure that you deliver the solution in its entirety, not fragmented into parts.
- The code should be ready to be copied and pasted directly into the target file, completely replacing the existing content without the need for additional adjustments. Edit should not break any existing functionality.
- If any code involves an API key, include the actual API key in your response. If database rules need to be updated, give me the complete revised set of rules.
- Make no assumptions. If you aren't certain about something, ask.
- Clearly specify the name of the affected file and the exact path where it is located to ensure error-free integration and efficient code management.

In the login screen, can you edit the "App Store Review Access" to enable reviewers to log in with just email/password? I enabled email/password login in firebase and added this as a user

We've resubmitted 1.0.2 for review. Please see our responses below. Thanks for your cooperation!

Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

The app is simple, as it's primarily an anonymous feed, but I've added more screenshots to demonstrate the app's full functionality.

Guideline 2.3.10 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

I apologize for the debug banners. The new screenshots do not have them.

Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

Scuttle doesn't directly handle sensitive military data or verification. We use ID.me, a trusted third-party service, to manage military status verification entirely outside our app. We only receive a verification token from ID.me, not sensitive military information. Firebase securely manages user accounts for verified service members, with no connection to their military records. For these reasons, we didn't believe Scuttle required organizational enrollment in the Apple Developer Program.

Guideline 4.8 - Design - Login Services

Since Scuttle is exclusively for verified service members, our only option is to use ID.me for authentication. ID.me is widely used by numerous government agencies and organizations for military and veteran verification. As a Navy veteran, I personally use it to log into VA services. It's the only commercial secure method available to verify military status. We believe this qualifies under Guideline 4.8 as a "government or industry-backed citizen identification system or electronic ID to authenticate users," which should exempt us from the requirement to provide Sign in with Apple. If it doesn't, we'd appreciate any alternative solutions you might suggest.

The "App Store Review Access" button in build 1.0.2 is temporary for review purposes and will not be in the production build.

From Nate:
Sign in with Apple
Basic features
Then id.me auth and full access
