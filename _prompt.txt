Can you read the attached file thoroughly to understand the current state of the code for my app, Scuttlebutt? Here's a description: "Scuttlebutt is an anonymous social app designed for military personnel, providing a platform similar to Yik Yak and Fizz tailored for military commands. Upon account creation, users verify their military status via ID.me and select their current command from a list of nearby options, which can be updated if they move commands. The app features three main tabs: Home, Messages, Profile. The Home tab presents a feed of posts from the user's command, allowing toggling between the main feed and new posts, with the ability to upvote, downvote, and comment, fostering threaded discussions like Reddit. Messages enable direct messaging within the command, while Profile showcases user activity and accumulated points, termed "Butts." The Post tab simplifies the creation of new posts. Scuttlebutt aims to enhance on-base communication and community by providing a space for real-time, location-based, anonymous interactions."
